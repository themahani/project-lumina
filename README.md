# Project Lumina

Project Lumina is a collection of Fraud Detection algorithms using Graph Neural Networks.
It uses **MLFlow** for tracking model training and validation, and the models are developed using **PyTorch**.
The models are containerized using Docker and deployed on a K8s cluster with API endpoints.
